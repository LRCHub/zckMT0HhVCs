[00:27.95] Nothing I do makes much sense
[00:31.56] Say you don't really get me anymore
[00:35.92] I wonder if you ever did... if you ever did at all?
[00:43.89] Nothing I want means a lot
[01:04.73] Say you don't understand me like before
[01:09.35] I'm not sure if you ever did... if you ever did at all?
[01:36.85] 
[01:18.54] Nothing I think has a point
[01:21.38] Say you don't quite believe me anymore
[01:25.83] I wonder if you ever did... if you ever did at all?
[01:51.33] 
[01:34.52] Gets hard to guess the best way through
[01:38.04] The thing to do if none of this is true
[01:43.80] I wish I knew how to undo
[01:46.68] The doubt I hide inside
[01:49.27] I grew in you...
[01:57.27] 
[01:52.12] The knot I hide inside I tied in you...
[02:11.62] 
[02:09.43] Nothing I am shows the way
[02:11.62] Say you don't seem to know me like before
[02:16.01] I'm not sure if you ever did... if you ever did at all?
[02:43.51] 
[02:24.50] No nothing I do makes much sense
[02:28.31] Say you don't really get me anymore
[02:32.34] I wonder if you ever did... if you ever did at all?
[02:57.84] 
[02:40.07] Gets hard to guess the best way through
[02:44.65] The thing to do if none of this is true
[02:49.52] I wish I knew how to undo
[02:53.12] The knot I tied in you...
[02:55.38] When more or less the yes and no
[02:59.49] Is all for show it isn't really so...
[03:04.60] Look high and low where did we go?
[03:08.13] You moved too fast or maybe I just moved too slow?
[03:33.13] 
[03:20.16] There's so much noise...
[03:22.76] All the signal seems to fade away
[03:27.49] Too much noise...
[03:35.99] 
[03:30.32] Or could be this is how it always sounds
[03:34.68] With nothing left?
