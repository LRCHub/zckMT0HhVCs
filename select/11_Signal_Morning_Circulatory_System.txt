Signal morning flashing signs all around
Things that we said are all that you will believe
Places we go are all you can believe
Well i know in time things will be okay but i'm sure that something's out there
There is no radius today or tomorrow
There is no dark cloud in the sky

The things that we've said were all you could believe
The way that we've been were all you could believe
But i know in time things will be okay and i'm sure that something's out there
There is no radius today or tomorrow
There is no dark cloud in the sky

On this clear day you can hear the mountains in your breath
See colored grains pointing exits toward the vast vastness
To be and to say and to know the way and to have some fun
This is all we want to do
