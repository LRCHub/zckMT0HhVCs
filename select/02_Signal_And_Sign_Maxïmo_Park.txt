Well I've been waiting, here for hours
It's getting cold, position closed
New direction, new dawn
Consider this, my informal conplaint
Hope you felt cheated at home with your lies lies Lies lies lies
How long has it taken for you to look so sine fine fine fine fine
Don't waste your life
Just go outside
Well I've been waiting, to forget
How the pieces, just fell away
You left your hometown, where you grew up
I hadn't noticed how your action has changed
Did these lonely hands rob your time time time time time
When was the signal divorced from the sign sign sign sign sign
Illumination
Accusation
I'd like to meet her
But she won't see me
