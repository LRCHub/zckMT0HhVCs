Call me legendary, leave you in a cemetery
Backwoods, honeyberry, pretty bitch, Pretty cherry
Paid boy no secretary, just a walking missionary
Ya'll niggas ordinary, Water Boyz extraordinary
I'mma guide you to the place
When you make it then you safe
Fuck boys wanna flex, fuck boys get misplaced
You can catch me in my place
Shrimp with teriyaki steak
All I wanna do is eat
All I wanna do is face
Twenty blunts to myself
On repeat, everyday
On a beach or on a lake
I just wanna get away
Ya'll niggas a disgrace
Make music that go to waste
I'm so high don't know the date
So don't ask me what's today
Water Boyz entertain, Water boys hurricane
On yo' whole little movement
Leave you washed up in the rain
I'm just trynna make some money
Then, dip off on a plane
Headed to the next city I just hope ain't no delays
Car service hit the front, L.V's on my bag
Still a broke young nigga
I ain't even trynna brag
But my debit card rich
I ain't even gotta sack
Still get shit that I want
That I never ever had
I'm a menice young nigga
All I know is touch and grab
I'm a violent young nigga
All I know is punch and stab
Ya'll niggas ain't shit
I'm a shark, you a crab
You can get with the squad
Or you can drown like the last (bitch)
Who you bitches fooling
They know that I do this
Young Kenshin is ruthless
This niggas is so stupid
Don't judge me on my music
Water Boyz the movement
The plan is so soothing
Demand and you losing
